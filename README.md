### Work Experience 
- Bookkeeping Assistant - Solution Innovators LLC, South Windsor, CT 
> In my role, I work with the accounting department to handle multiple internal and external jobs for the company. My responsibilities include monthly billing their clientele, reconciling of the books, managing sales tax, and calculating the biweekly payroll for employees. Communication is a vital part of my job; I regularly interact with different departments and senior employees to monitor the progress of tasks and ensure efficient completion. This interaction provides me with valuable exposure to the corporate environment, especially within an LLC structure.
- STEM Tutor - The Master's School, West Simsbury, CT
  > I was recognized for my outstanding academic proficiency and was selected by my school's directors among the top 10% of my class to serve as a specialized tutor in STEM subjects. My role involved providing in-depth instruction in key STEM areas such as basic Python programming, chemistry, biology, and calculus. I utilized my extensive knowledge in these subjects to improve students' understanding, academic performance, problem-solving abilities, and critical thinking. To ensure effective learning, I adopted a student-centered teaching approach. This involved tailoring my instructional methods to meet the individual learning styles and needs of each student. My focus was on creating a supportive and effective educational environment, where students could thrive in their STEM studies in and out of. This experience was not only a testament to my academic abilities but also to my skill in imparting knowledge in a way that is accessible and engaging for students.


### Projects 
- Snake Game (Python)
> In my perosonal project, I focused on creating a Snake game utilizing object-oriented programming principles where the primary goal is for users to guide a snake to consume as many balls as possible without colliding with walls or the snake itself. As the game progresses, the snake grows in size, speeds ups, and food items appear randomly on the board. To achieve this, I employed object-oriented programming principles in Python, which allowed me to encapsulate the game's logic within various objects. This approach greatly enhanced the efficiency of managing the game's behavior and state. My responsibilities encompassed the entire software development lifecycle, including coding, testing, and debugging, to ensure the game performed optimally and provided an enjoyable user experience.
